            <h2>What is it for?</h2>
            <p class="margin_bottom">Insulin Buddy is a website for helping you manage your diabetes. It provides a friendly, motivating
                environment in which to record your daily insulin doses taken, blood glucose, weight, and exercise
                measurements. This information is directly linked to your clinician, allowing them to monitor your
                health status and send you encouraging messages.</p>

            <h2>About the creators</h2>
            <p class="margin_bottom">We're a team of university students studying web development at the University of Melbourne. We love
                creating websites, and we love helping other people, so we were excited to do both with Insulin
                Buddy.</p>

                        <p>I used to find it really difficult to motivate myself to record my diabetes data, but I love going onto Insulin Buddy - it's so cute and it's awesome to compete against other members.</p>
